    Alex K. Jones received the BS degree in 1998 in physics from the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, VA, USA, and the MS and PhD degrees in 2000 and 2002, respectively, in ECE from Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA. He is a Professor of ECE and CS at the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. He is currently serving as a Program Director at the US NSF in the CNS Division of the CISE Directorate.  Dr. Jones' research interests include compilation for configurable systems and architectures, scaled and emerging memory, reliability, fault tolerance, quantum computing, and sustainable computing. He is the author of more than 200 publications in these areas. His research is funded by the NSF, DARPA, NSA, and industry. He is an active member of program committees in the computer architecture, design automation, and sustainable computing areas.  He is the steering committee chair for the IEEE International Green and Sustainable Computing Conference, an associate editor for the IEEE Transactions on Computers, and Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems Journal. He is a senior member of the IEEE and the ACM.

    Dr. Jones' research interests are broadly in the area of computer architecture.  He is currently investigating quantum system codesign including design of basis gates, topologies, and transpilation from resonator devices to systems.  He is also actively developing nanoscale magnetic memory systems including spin-transfer-torque and Racetrack memories with an emphasis on processing in memory.  His other interests include reliability and fault-tolerance, computing and memories in harsh environments such as space, compilation techniques for configurable systems and architectures, and sustainable computing, among others.  He has more than 200 publications in these areas.  His research is funded by NSF, DARPA, NSA, and industry.
