To effectively solve current and future computing problems it is not enough to develop new architectures or design new software. The solution must address concerns across many layers of the system.  Moreover, emerging concerns of energy and sustainability, security, and fault tolerance require complementary techniques to develop complete systems.

Topics:

- Fault Tolerant Memory and Storage Systems

- Compiler, OS, and Storage Design for Processing in Memory

- Securing the Industrial Internet of Things

- Radiation Tolerant Space Computing Systems

- Sustainable Computing
